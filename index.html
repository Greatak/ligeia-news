                    <p>The Titan Preservation Front's enforcement militias are violently enforcing injunctions and protecting study teams. Hicar is leading the defense to contest those injunctions with their own Security Directorate, including employee conscripts. <a href=#>Learn more about the combatants and DROs</a></p>

                    <h3>What is the conflict about?<span class=arrow></span></h3>
                    <p>Ligeia is the largest freshane lake on Titan and the Titan Preservation Front seeks to expand the Kraken Reserve to include it for ecological study. The region is among the most economically productive and closing the chemical plants would strike a heavy blow to the moon. <a href=#>Learn more about what's at stake</a></p>

                    <h3>What has happened?<span class=arrow></span></h3>
                    <p>In May, 2167 the Titan Preservation Front secured emergency injunctions to seize chemical refineries to stop production pending a study of the local ecosystem. Hicar and other firms immediately contested this and the region has become engulfed in open conflict. <a href=#>Explore the whole timeline</a></p>

                    <h3>Who is affected?<span class=arrow></span></h3>
                    <p>Though most of the employees of the chemical companies have been evacuated, hundreds of thousands of people live in Ligeia and earn a living in secondary industries. With the major industry shut down and open conflict across the region, Ligeia is quickly becoming one of the largest humanitarian crises of our time. <a href=#>Learn more about the fallout and who it impacts</a></p>
