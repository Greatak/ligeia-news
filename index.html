                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Fighting between environmentalist militias and local security forces around the Ligeia Sea on Titan threaten to engulf the whole moon. Travel restrictions, furloughs and violence have led to many fleeing the area and ecosystem disruptions have led to widespread life support collapses in a quickly growing humanitarian crisis.</p>
                <p>The environmentalist militias under the banner of the Titan Preservation Front occupied 17 properties owned by Hicar, Uanui Extraction and Poritrin Polymers on 21 May, 2167. The facilities were immediately closed and their workers locked into their apartments. Hicar’s Security Directorate mobilized to evacuate their employees but were attacked by the Front soldiers when they arrived.</p>
                <p>An intense legal battle has followed, primarily between Ecotration Advocates and Ebersbacher, Fiser and Duncan. Ecotration Advocates is a DRO with judgments across Sol mostly in favor of environmental causes. Ebersbacher, Fiser and Duncan is based out of Caneca Station as the primary arbiter in the Chronian system. Soldiers on both sides rely on writs from these two DROs and consensus on this crisis is looking increasingly unlikely.</p>
                <p>Amid the violence, Titan's economy is faltering. Production from the northern refineries has completely stopped and investment of any sort has frozen colder than the icy sea being contested. Without the money from Titan's primary chemical industries, life support failures are becoming increasingly common and gang activity has increased substantially. The humanitarian crisis has grown to the point that Valkyr observers monitoring the situation are urging both sides to find a way to deescalate before they take action.</p>
                <h2>Combatants</h2>
                <p class=see-also>Main Article: <a href=#>Who is fighting?</a></p>
                <p>The fighting on Titan is considered a just conflict by the dispute resolution community. This means that though fighting has been intense and disruptive, all parties have been supplied with legitimate writs and there is no consensus among dispute resolution organizations. Ecotration Advocates has sided with the Front while Ebersbacher, Fiser and Duncan has sided with Hicar and the other chemical producers. Both DROs have high standing in the community and their writs are considered valid.</p>
                <p>The Titan Preservation Front is an environmental advocacy group that was responsible for the establishment of the Kraken Reserve following the discovery of microbial life there. The Front quickly militarized after that mostly by uniting the various eco-militias of Titan. They are now seeking to expand the Kraken Reserve to include the Vid and Svoel Deltas. Despite their closely aligned goals, the Gendustry Group on Titan does not support the conflict in Ligeia.</p>
                <p>Hicar is the largest chemical producer on Titan, accounting for nearly 20% of Titan’s GDP. They operate extensively all around Ligeia, including the Vid Delta where the fighting is the most intense. Uanui Extraction and Poritrin Polymers also have properties seized by the Front, but Hicar’s Security Directorate is leading the fight. Facing collapse from the plant closures, Uanui Extraction has completely mobilized their conscription forces.</p>
                <h2>Causes</h2>
                <p class=see-also>Main Article: <a href=#>What is the conflict about?</a></p>
                <p>Titan is widely known as a popular place for holidays and retirement, the bedroom community of Saturn, but near the north pole, it is a very different environment. The shores of the Ligeia Sea are lined with refineries and sprawling industrial complexes, producing hydrocarbons and other chemicals that support industry all across the Outer System. Though many firms operate here, Hicar is the industry leader. Their role in the Titan economy is not just a chemical producer, but also an infrastructure provider, residential services and a chain of commissaries that serve all of Titan.</p>
                <p>In the early surveys of Titan, microbial life was discovered in the Kraken Mare. This led to the establishment of the Kraken Reserve, prohibiting industrial exploitation of the area. Around the Reserve, a weaker set of restrictions was placed, including the Ligeia Sea. Throughout early 2167, Hicar expanded their refineries in the Vid Delta. Despite opposition and a public mitigation plan before construction, the Front alleges that Hicar violated the Kraken Ethaneshed Agreement and threatens the integrity of yet-to-be-surveyed ecology that may reside in the Delta. Hicar maintains that their mitigation plan was vetted and accepted before construction and they have taken every precaution to preserve any yet-to-be-discovered life; these injunctions are a threat to the economic stability of Ligeia.</p>
